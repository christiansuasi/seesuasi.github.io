Undergraduate Student @ Rutgers University studying Computer Science

The State University of New Jersey and in-state tuition is cheap. I get to be close to my home in Ridgewood while having quick access to NYC.

Future:
</p>

<p>Business Technology Associate at Pfizer
</p>

<p>
As I'm still learning and exploring, I chose Pfizer because I get to be exposed to cutting-edge, modern technologies. For 6 months at a time, I can switch to various teams throughout the company in order to gain useful insight and different skills. Although I may stick to development.
